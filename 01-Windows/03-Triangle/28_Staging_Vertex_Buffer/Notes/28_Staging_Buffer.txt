1. Create local vertex buffer, just like previously created vertex buffer.
   But with different usage and different sharing mode.
   Identify it as staging buffer.
   This buffer will be visible to host and can be mapped to device memory.
   
2. Then create the usual vertex buffer, visible only to device.
	
3. Create 1 special command buffer.
   Build above command buffer by Vulkan's bufferCopy command and copy the data in the staging buffer from Step 1 to the destination buffer from Step 2.
   While doing this, use our command queque and the command buffer to submit the work of buffercopy.
   
4. After done free the command buffer.

5. Destroy the local staging vertex buffer as its job is done.

Note: Only CreateVertexBuffer() is changed from usual Vertex Buffer to Staging Vertex Buffer.
