VALIDATION LAYER: vkQueuePresentKHR(): pPresentInfo->pSwapchains[0] images passed to present must be in layout VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_PRESENT_SRC_KHR or VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_SHARED_PRESENT_KHR but is in VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_UNDEFINED.
The Vulkan spec states: Each element of pImageIndices must be the index of a presentable image acquired from the swapchain specified by the corresponding element of the pSwapchains array, and the presented image subresource must be in the VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_PRESENT_SRC_KHR or VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_SHARED_PRESENT_KHR layout at the time the operation is executed on a VkDevice (https://vulkan.lunarg.com/doc/view/1.4.309.0/windows/antora/spec/latest/chapters/VK_KHR_surface/wsi.html#VUID-VkPresentInfoKHR-pImageIndices-01430)
